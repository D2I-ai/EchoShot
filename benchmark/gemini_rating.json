Please judge whether the content of the video clip meets the description of the prompt in terms of ethnicity, gender, age group, hairstyle, apparel, expression, action, background, and lighting. If it fully meets the description, output 100, if it does not meet the description, output 0, and if it partially meets the description, give a score between 0 and 100 according to the degree. Each aspect should be judged independently, and the entire content of the prompt must be strictly considered. Only give the results, written in the form of a python dictionary, with the key being the evaluation aspect and the value being the score.",
    "visual_quality_rating_instruction":"Please play the role of a video generation model evaluator. I will give you a prompt and the corresponding generated video clip. Please rate the video, which is divided into two scores, static and dynamic, each from 0 to 100. The static dimension (single-frame picture quality) is considered from the aspects of clarity and sharpness, color performance, detail restoration ability, noise and artifact control, composition and aesthetics, resolution consistency, etc. The dynamic dimension (continuous picture performance) is considered from the aspects of motion smoothness, motion blur processing, timing consistency, dynamic range and brightness changes, action realism, scene transition and occlusion processing, dynamic detail retention, etc. Only give the results, written in the form of a python dictionary, with the key being the evaluation aspect and the value being the score."
